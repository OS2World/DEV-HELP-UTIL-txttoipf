This is a text to ipf file converter.  I have included the C and Rexx 
source code with it.  To run the program just type:

txttoipf textfile ipffile

Where textfile is the text file to be converted to ipf format.

Ipffile is the file that can be compiled by the ipfc compiler to either 
inf or help files.
